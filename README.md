Visualization Overview

Overview
This project provides an interactive data visualization of road accidents, built using Tableau with the support of Python for geocoding. The goal is to offer insights into the spatial distribution of accidents, including zip code-specific analysis. The visualizations highlight patterns, trends, and correlations, enabling a deeper understanding of factors influencing road accidents

The visualization is divided into several key dashboards:
1)Accident Overview: A general overview of road accidents, including total accidents, injuries, and fatalities.
2)Geospatial Dashboard: A map-based visualization highlighting accident locations, severity, and density.
3)Time Series Analysis: Visualizations depicting the frequency of accidents over different time intervals (years, months, etc.).
4)Factors Influencing Accidents: Charts showing the influence of external factors such as weather, road conditions, and time of day.

Project Structure
1)Tableau Workbook: The core of the project, a Tableau Workbook (DV_Project.twbx), containing all the data visualizations and dashboards.
